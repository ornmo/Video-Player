This project is a video player. 

The video can be played and paused by pressing anywhere in the video. 

When the USer hovers towards the bottom of the video a video control menu bar opens. 
The User can change the volume of the video, the speed of the video playback, the size of the screen and even select a point in the video to navigate to.
